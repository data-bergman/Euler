## Project Euler

This repository contains answers to certain project Euler questions. This project is a set of math problems that are more easily solved using a mix of coding and mathematical reasoning. These projects were, for the most part, undertaken in late 2018 and early 2019 (Y1 Bsc) with the purpose of improving python skills. This repository also includes various other miscelaneous projects.
